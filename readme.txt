       I don't wanna be an @
===================================
(Read: I don't wanna be an at sign)

This is a game created for the 26th Ludum Dare competition.
The theme for the competition was Minimalism.

The game mechanics are quite simple:
1) You go right, and get scored based on how far you have reached.
2) The walls move towards you every now and then. Oh and if you touch them you lose.
3) There are people running the other way, they cost you time whether by having to bypass them or by forcing you to beat them up.


How do I start the game?
========================
To run the game just start "main.bat".

Why the heck did you write a game in Batch?
===========================================
Because it seemed funny at the time. 
I still think it's rather amusing :)

Why does the protagonist think being an @ sucks?
================================================
Because if your sprite comprises of 9 ASCII characters you're obviously at least 9 times better than any one-chracter sprite, Duh!
